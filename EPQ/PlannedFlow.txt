Define P vs NP:
    Define Asymptotic Notation
    Define P
    Define NP
    Explain what P = NP would mean
    Explain what P != NP would mean

Nature of proof:
    Logic, Axioms, Formal Systems
    Typical methods:
        reduction
        simulation arguments
        formal Systems
    - Why these are insufficient


Relativisation:
    Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975): Oracles A and B where P^A = NP^A, but P^B ≠ NP^B
    Intuition: Some proof techniques work regardless of oracle
    Implication: Any relativising technique can’t resolve P vs NP
    
Natural proofs:
    Razborov & Rudich (1994)
    Certain combinatorial techniques are too general—if they succeed, they also break cryptography
    Connection to pseudorandom functions
    Implication: Natural proof methods likely won’t work

Algebraization:
    Aaronson & Wigderson (2008)
    Generalisation of relativization using low-degree polynomials
    Some techniques algebrize but still can’t resolve P vs NP
    Implication: Even more powerful extensions fail

Conclusion:
    Explain why these barriers mean new methods are needed
    breifly mention geometric complexity theory and logical frameworks
    Personal reflection


Where possible explain graphically, simpler and uses less words
Consider counterarguments
